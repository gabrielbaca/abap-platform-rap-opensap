## Create database tables
1. Create package ZRAP_TRAVEL_SFMX
2. Add to favorites the parent package
### Travel database table
3. Create travel database table ZRAP_ATRAV_SFMX
4. Replace code
    ```ABAP
    @EndUserText.label : 'Travel data'
    @AbapCatalog.enhancementCategory : #NOT_EXTENSIBLE
    @AbapCatalog.tableCategory : #TRANSPARENT
    @AbapCatalog.deliveryClass : #A
    @AbapCatalog.dataMaintenance : #RESTRICTED
    define table zrap_atrav_sfmx {
      key client            : mandt not null;
      key travel_uuid       : sysuuid_x16 not null;
      travel_id             : /dmo/travel_id;
      agency_id             : /dmo/agency_id;
      customer_id           : /dmo/customer_id;
      begin_date            : /dmo/begin_date;
      end_date              : /dmo/end_date;
      @Semantics.amount.currencyCode : 'zrap_atrav_sfmx.currency_code'
      booking_fee           : /dmo/booking_fee;
      @Semantics.amount.currencyCode : 'zrap_atrav_sfmx.currency_code'

      last_changed_at       : timestampl;
      local_last_changed_at : timestampl;
    }
    ```
### Booking database table
5. Create booking database table ZRAP_ABOOK_SFMX
6. Replace code
    ```ABAP
    @EndUserText.label : 'Booking data'

### Table data generator
9. Create class ZCL_GENERATE_DEMO_DATA_SFMX
10. Replace code (Remember to refactor methods into delete and populate)
    ```ABAP
    METHOD if_oo_adt_classrun~main.

        ORDER BY 
            travel_id UP TO 200 ROWS
      ).
    COMMIT WORK.

## Create Data Model with CDS
### Travel CDS
1. Create travel CDS ZI_RAP_TRAVEL_SFMX (any template, will replace)
2. Replace code
    ```ABAP
    @AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #CHECK
    @EndUserText.label: 'Travel BO view'
    define view entity zi_rap_travel_sfmx
    as select from zrap_atrav_sfmx as Travel
